### The purpose of this report is to investigate the historical dataset processed.heartdisease.txt that includes 303 patients at risk of heart disease displaying 14 different recorded fields.The following questions were investigated utilizing EDA and multivariate data interpretation techniques: 
### 1. Are there notable associations/relationships between some of the variables? Are there any meaningful groups of variables that exhibit these associations? If so, describe them.
### 2. Is there a way to graphically represent the raw data for the 303 patients and draw conclusions about the data set from such a graph?
### 3. What are the basic underlying groups that the individuals form? Can you plot the data in a small number of dimensions, showing the group separation of the patients?
### 4. Are there interesting differences in any of the recorded fields with respect to heart disease diagnosis? 
### 5. If the researchers were to investigate a new patient observation that had known measurements for the 13 explanatory variables, could we determine a rule for predicting that patient's heart disease status (no heart disease vs presence of heart disease)? How accurate could you expect such a rule to be?
